This file contains the issues identified during the development of CMR CSW.  It
is focused on differences between the IDN/GCMD CSW and CMR CSW mainly due to
the initial CMR Search capabilities, which contains functionality which is
exposed via a CSW standard.

### GetCapabilities findings ### 
##### Quick summary #####
The initial CMR CSW implementation will focus on using existing CMR search
functionality.  Once the need for additional supports exists, we might 
consider expanding CMR search and subsequently CMR CSW based on new CMR
search functionality.
##### Issues #####
* Queryables (filtering properties)

    The initial CMR queryable properties will be a subset of the GCMD CSW
queryable properties.  The GCMD supported queryables supported by CMR CSW
are:
    "Title"
    "Anytext"
    "Identifier"
    "Modified"
    "RevisionDate"
    "OrganisationName"
    "ResourceIdentifier"
    "TempExtent_begin"
    "TempExtent_end"
    "Project"
    "Platform"
    "Location"
    "ScienceKeywords"
    "Instrument"

    The GCMD queryables that CMR CSW will **not support**  in the initial 
implementation:
    "Subject"
    "Abstract"
    "Format"
    "Type"
    "AlternateTitle"
    "CreationDate"
    "PublicationDate"
    "HasSecurityConstraints"
    "Language"
    "ParentIdentifier"
    "KeywordType"
    "TopicCategory"
    "ResourceLanguage"
    "ServiceType"
    "ServiceTypeVersion"
    "Operation"
    "Denominator"
    "DistanceValue"
    "DistanceUOM"
    "GeographicDescription Code"
    "CouplingType"
    "OperatesOn"
    "OperatesOnIdentifier"
    "OperatesOnName"
    "Lineage"
    "ConditionApplyingToAccessAndUse"
    "AccessConstraints"
    "OnlineResourceMimeType"
    "ResponsiblePartyRole"
    "OnlineResourceType"
    "SpecificationDate"
    "MetadataPointOfContact"
    "Classification"
    "OtherConstraints"
    "Degree"
    "SpecificationTitle"

* Query Language 
    The two flavors of query language are:
    * the OGC filter
    * the Common Query language
    We'll have to write translators from the supported flavors to the CMR
    search query language.
    
    The initial CMR CSW specification will support FILTER as the initial constraint
laguage. Learn about the [OGC Filter constraint language] (http://schemas.opengis.net/filter/).  
The Common Query Language (CQL) will only be supported if needed.  Learn about CQL [here] (http://zing.z3950.org/cql/intro.html).

* Spatial capabilities
    The spatial capabilities comprise of Spatial Operators and Geometry Operands.  They are
a bit randomly qualified in the GCMD GetCapabilities.
    * Spatial Operators
        The spatial operators supported by CMR CSW are:
        "Intersects"
        "BBOX" - for some reason, OpenGis classifies BBOX as a spatial operator instead
        of a geometry operand, together with Point, Line, Polygon
        
        The spatial operators **not supported** by the CMR CSW initial implementation are:
        "Equals"
        "Overlaps" (we will map this to "Intersects")
        "Disjoint" 
        "Touches" (we will map this to "Intersects")
        "Crosses" (we will can map this to "Intersects")
        "Within"
        "Contains"
    * Geometry Operands
        The geometry operands supported by CMR CSW are:
        "Point"
        "Line"
        "Polygon"

        The geometry operands **not supported** by the CMR CSW initial implementation:
        "Envelope"

### GetRecords ###
##### Quick summary #####
* The CMR CSW GetRecords request is only supported via POST.  GCMD does not support 
GetRecords GET even though it is in the GetCapabilities.  Neither does CWIC but CWIC
returns a meaningful error message (REQUEST_EXCEPTION: UNRECOGNIZED_REQUEST - Only Getcapabilities, 
DescribeRecord and GetRecordById supported for HTTP GET method).  Probably the reason is that one can't 
express meaningful queries via the query parameters unless one supports some basic CQL.  The only way CWIC
and GCMD CSW support GetRecords is via POST and request payloads that contain the query / filter.  For now 
the CMR CSW GetRecords GET always returns an exception stating that only POST is supported.  
That is also reflected in the CMR CSW GetCapabilities response.
